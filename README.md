# BlenderShortcuts

This is one quick and small page because I was tired of always googling for a Blender Shortcut.
Shortcuts that I find useful are collected in here in case I forget them to quickly find them again.
It will grow over time.

I plan to enhance and refine it over time (see below), I just wanted to make it work quickly now.  

## TODOs
### bigger (enhance)
- Search
- better component structure 
- Dark Mode
- Apple Shortcuts 
- English Localization
- Filtering (not just headlines but hoppers at the top that show only selected)
- Favs (+ local storage)
- Export as PDF
- Approaches (fold along an edge, cutting a hole etc.)

### smaller and quality (refine)
- change units to relative units 
- use better semantics
- configure tailwind custom classes 
- refine spacings/font sizes/styles etc.
- use the structural card
- data structure
