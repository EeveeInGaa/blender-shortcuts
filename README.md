# BlenderShortcuts

This is one quick and small page because I was tired of always googling for a Blender Shortcut.
Shortcuts that I find useful are collected in here in case I forget them to quickly find them again.
It will grow over time.

I plan to enhance and refine it over time (see below), I just wanted to make it work quickly now.  

## TODOs
### bigger (enhance)
- [x] Search
- [x] Dark Mode
- [x] mobile version
- [ ] better component structure 
- [ ] Apple Shortcuts 
- [ ] German Localization
- [ ] Filtering (not just headlines but hoppers at the top that show only selected)
- [ ] Favs (+ local storage)
- [ ] Export as PDF
- [ ] Approaches (fold along an edge, cutting a hole etc.)
- [ ] add tests (search, favs, filtering)

### smaller and quality (refine)
- [ ] change units to relative units 
- [ ] use better semantics
- [ ] configure tailwind custom classes 
- [ ] refine spacings/font sizes/styles etc.
- [ ] use the structural card
- [ ] add grid columns
- [ ] data structure
